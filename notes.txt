CanLoad :
Controls if a route can even be loaded. This becomes useful for feature modules that are lazy loaded.
They won’t even load if the guard returns false.

CanDeactivate :
Controls if the user can leave a route. Note that this guard doesn’t prevent the user from closing the
browser tab or navigating to a different address. It only prevents actions from within the application itself.

Can we specify multiple guards for a single route?
We could specify multiple guards for a single route,
and they’ll be evaluated in the order in which they are specified.

The CanDeactivate guard has a slight difference in its implementation
in that we need to provide the component to be deactivated.
export class CanActivateRouteGuard implements CanDeactivate<DashboardComponent> {
  canDeactivate(component: DashboardComponent): boolean {
    if (component.unsavedChanges) {
      return confirm('Are you sure?');
    }
    return true;
  }
}
