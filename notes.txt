Suppose there are two components A and B. A passes data to B through input property binding and lets say
it passed an array like:

<B [data]="datasArray"></B>

Now when we have ChangeDetectionStrategy mentioned as onPush in B, Angular will avoid detecting any changes
in component B unless an input property reference changes like:

1. In A.ts:

addFood(food) {
    this.foods.push(food);
}

Here B won't notice the change.

2. In A.ts:

addFood(food) {
  this.foods = [...this.foods, food];
}

Here B will notice the change as there is a change in reference in input property.



ChangeDetectorRef:
Can still use method (1) shown above and get data reflected in B with ChangeDetectorRef. Just put a button
in B and execute a click event like:

refresh() {
    this.cd.detectChanges();
}
