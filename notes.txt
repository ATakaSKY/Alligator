Ususally with an observable when we subscribe to it there must be a moment when we should unsubscribe
from it as well in order to prevent any memory leaks. This place is generally ngOnDestroy().

But with async we don't have to worry about subscribing as well as unsubscribing as async pipe takes
care of both the things for us.
